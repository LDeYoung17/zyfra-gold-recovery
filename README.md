# zyfra-gold-recovery

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project examines different machine learning models to evaluate the best one to predict the maximum ore extracted in the ore purification process. Exploratory data analysis was also completed. 

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Evaluation (notebooks > EDA_ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Recovery calculation - calculating the MAE based on calculated and provided recovery values
        d) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        e) Beginning of EDA: Comparing metal concentrations at different stages of purification (histograms)
        f) Evaluating metal particle size distributions in test and train sets (histograms)
        g) Beginning of Machine Learning Model Evaluation: sMAPE functions and splitting the data
        h) Functions to train the different models
        i) Calling the functions to evaluate the model efficacy
        j) Creating and evaluating Dummy Regressor and comparing to machine learning model chosen
        k) Project conclusion


<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.9.13 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebooks, they can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for updates</h2>

There are no plans for updates at this time.
